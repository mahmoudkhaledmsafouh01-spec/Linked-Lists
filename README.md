# Linked Lists

A small Node.js project that implements linked lists in both class-based and factory-function styles.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the demo script to see a populated list printed to the console:
   ```bash
   npm run demo
   ```
3. Run the unit tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The project uses ES modules with Jest. The provided test script already passes the required flag to support ESM imports.
